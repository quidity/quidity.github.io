<P>We need to be careful about who joins this project they have to understand github.
<P>To help this project you need to start by demonstrating your understanding of github issues.
<P>One way to demonstrate github skills is to search for issues, then create a new issue. This is a basic but important github skill.</P>
<P>1. summarize some issues: Go to github issues (go to github.com then navigate to https://github.com/issues) and summarize your current assigned issues.
<P>2. Create new issues for "@quidity": Create a new issue containing the summary and assign it to the user "@quidity".
<P>3. We will review the issue and you can join the project. We look forward to helping you join the project!</P>
